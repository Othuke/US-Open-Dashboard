### Potential Improvements

The beauty of data analysis is the continuous opportunity for enhancement. Some improvements that can definitely be made:

-   **Interactive Filters:** Implement filters to allow users to explore data by specific years, players, or match rounds for a more personalized experience.
-   **Expanded Tournament Data:** Integrate data from other Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon) for a deeper, comparative analysis of player performance across different court surfaces and conditions.
-   **Deeper Player Statistics:** Add more granular data points like ace counts, unforced errors, and first serve percentage to enable a more detailed tactical analysis of matches.
-   **Predictive Analytics:** Explore the possibility of building basic predictive models based on historical data to forecast future match outcomes or player performance.
-   **Data Updates:** Implement a mechanism to automatically update the dashboard with new data as it becomes available (for future tournaments).
